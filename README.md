# forex_algo_trader
This is a forex trading algorithm developed by JTang1991 for learning purposes.
This project is intended to study harmonic patterns and flag Gartley, Butterfly,
Bat and Crab patterns to the user in a backtesting manner or as a live trading
environment. In addition it calculates the P&L payoff in the backtest to 
provide an estimate of the success rate of the patterns.
This is a development program and by no means guranteed to provide returns in 
a live trading setting. The author is not liable for any losses incurred from this 
trading program.
